    testimonial: "Stanley is exactly the sort of software developer that any company would love. I worked with him building a couple of Single Page Applications (SPA), using JavaScript and React, Boostrap, and more, while struggling with a tough data structures problem, and within a few hours, he'd managed to explain a concept I'd been struggling with for days. He has a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, and as a junior developer, that was really valuable for me. He is also just a fun person to chat with! If you need to get a job done simply and efficiently, Stanley is definitely the right person for you.",
